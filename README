A toy to explore with the Alternative Vote system proposed in the 2011 referendum.

Also experimenting with using Javascript in a more functional style (side effects are used to render results to the DOM).

Enter ballots into the text area in the following form:

pref:n

Where pref is a list of candidates in preferred order (candidates must be uppercase A-I) and n is the number of voters with this preference.

Once a candidate has been eliminated, their colour is shown faded in the subsequent vote counts.
